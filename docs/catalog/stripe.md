# Stripe

[Stripe](https://stripe.com) is an API driven online payment processing utility. `supabase/wrappers` exposes below endpoints.

!!! warning

    Restoring a logical backup of a database with a materialized view using a foreign table can fail. For this reason, either do not use foreign tables in materialized views or use them in databases with physical backups enabled.

## Preparation

Before you can query Stripe, you need to enable the Wrappers extension and store your credentials in Postgres.

### Enable Wrappers

Make sure the `wrappers` extension is installed on your database:

```sql
create extension if not exists wrappers with schema extensions;
```

### Enable the Stripe Wrapper

Enable the `stripe_wrapper` FDW:

```sql
create foreign data wrapper stripe_wrapper
  handler stripe_fdw_handler
  validator stripe_fdw_validator;
```

### Store your credentials

We need to provide Postgres with the credentials to connect to Stripe, and any additional options. We can do this using the `create server` command:

=== "With Vault"

    By default, Postgres stores FDW credentials inside `pg_catalog.pg_foreign_server` in plain text. Anyone with access to this table will be able to view these credentials.

    Wrappers is designed to work with [Vault](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/vault), which provides an additional level of security for storing credentials. We recommend using Vault to store your credentials.

    ```sql
    -- Save your Stripe API key in Vault and retrieve the `key_id`
    insert into vault.secrets (name, secret)
    values (
      'stripe',
      'YOUR_SECRET'
    )
    returning key_id;
    ```
    Reference the credentials using the Key ID or Key Name:

    ```sql
    create server stripe_server
      foreign data wrapper stripe_wrapper
      options (
        api_key_id '<key_ID>', -- The Key ID from above, required if api_key_name is not specified.
        api_key_name '<key_Name>', -- The Key Name from above, required if api_key_id is not specified.
        api_url 'https://api.stripe.com/v1/',  -- Stripe API base URL, optional. Default is 'https://api.stripe.com/v1/'
        api_version '2024-06-20'  -- Stripe API version, optional. Default is your Stripe account’s default API version.
      );
    ```

=== "Without Vault"

    ```sql
    create server stripe_server
      foreign data wrapper stripe_wrapper
      options (
        api_key '<Stripe API Key>',  -- Stripe API key, required
        api_url 'https://api.stripe.com/v1/',  -- Stripe API base URL, optional. Default is 'https://api.stripe.com/v1/'
        api_version '2024-06-20'  -- Stripe API version, optional. Default is your Stripe account’s default API version.
      );
    ```

### Create a schema

We recommend creating a schema to hold all the foreign tables:

```sql
create schema stripe;
```

## Creating Foreign Tables

The Stripe Wrapper supports data read and modify from Stripe API.

The Stripe foreign tables mirror Stripe's API.

We can then create the foreign table, for example:

```sql
create foreign table stripe.accounts (
  id text,
  business_type text,
  country text,
  email text,
  type text,
  created timestamp,
  attrs jsonb
)
  server stripe_server
  options (
    object 'accounts'
  );
```

`attrs` is a special column which stores all the object attributes in JSON format, you can extract any attributes needed or its associated sub objects from it. See more examples below.

### Accounts

This is an object representing a Stripe account.

Ref: [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api/accounts/list)

#### Operations

| Object                                                | Select | Insert | Update | Delete | Truncate |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :------: |
| [Accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api/accounts/list) |   ✅   |   ❌   |   ❌   |   ❌   |    ❌    |

#### Usage

```sql
create foreign table stripe.accounts (
  id text,
  business_type text,
  country text,
  email text,
  type text,
  created timestamp,
  attrs jsonb
)
  server stripe_server
  options (
    object 'accounts'
  );
```

#### Notes

- While any column is allowed in a where clause, it is most efficient to filter by `id`.

### Balance

_read only_

Shows the balance currently on your Stripe account.

Ref: [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api/balance)

```sql
create foreign table stripe.balance (
  balance_type text,
  amount bigint,

  attrs jsonb
)
  server stripe_server
  options (
    object 'balance'
  );
```

### Balance Transactions

_read only_

Balance transactions represent funds moving through your Stripe account. They're created for every type of transaction that comes into or flows out of your Stripe account balance.

Ref: [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api/balance_transactions/list)

```sql
create foreign table stripe.balance_transactions (
  id text,
  amount bigint,
  currency text,

  net bigint,
  status text,
  type text,
  created timestamp,
  attrs jsonb

```sql
create foreign table stripe.charges (
  id text,
  amount bigint,
  currency text,
  customer text,

  options (
    object 'charges'
  );
```

While any column is allowed in a where clause, it is most efficient to filter by:

- id

```sql
create foreign table stripe.checkout_sessions (
  id text,
  customer text,

## Query Pushdown Support

This FDW supports `where` clause pushdown. You can specify a filter in `where` clause and it will be passed to Stripe API call.

For example, this query

```sql
select * from stripe.customers where id = 'cus_xxx';
```

will be translated Stripe API call: `https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/cus_xxx`.

For supported filter columns for each object, please check out foreign table documents above.

## Examples

Some examples on how to use Stripe foreign tables.

### Basic example

```sql
-- always limit records to reduce API calls to Stripe
select * from stripe.customers limit 10;
select * from stripe.invoices limit 10;
select * from stripe.subscriptions limit 10;
```

### Query JSON attributes

```sql
-- extract account name for an invoice
select id, attrs->>'account_name' as account_name
from stripe.invoices where id = 'in_xxx';

-- extract invoice line items for an invoice
select id, attrs#>'{lines,data}' as line_items
from stripe.invoices where id = 'in_xxx';

-- extract subscription items for a subscription
select id, attrs#>'{items,data}' as items
from stripe.subscriptions where id = 'sub_xxx';
```

### Data modify

```sql
insert into stripe.customers(email,name,description) values ('test@test.com', 'test name', null);
update stripe.customers set description='hello fdw' where id ='cus_xxx';
update stripe.customers set attrs='{"metadata[foo]": "bar"}' where id ='cus_xxx';
delete from stripe.customers where id ='cus_xxx';
```

To insert into an object with sub-fields, we need to create the foreign table with column name exactly same as the API required. For example, to insert a `subscription` object we can define the foreign table following [the Stripe API docs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create):

```sql
-- create the subscription table for data insertion, the 'customer'
-- and 'items[0][price]' fields are required.
create foreign table stripe.subscriptions (
  id text,
  customer text,
  "items[0][price]" text  -- column name will be used in API Post request
)
  server stripe_server
  options (
    object 'subscriptions',
    rowid_column 'id'
  );
```

And then we can insert a subscription like below:

```sql
insert into stripe.subscriptions (customer, "items[0][price]")
values ('cus_Na6dX7aXxi11N4', 'price_1MowQULkdIwHu7ixraBm864M');
```

Note this foreign table is only for data insertion, it cannot be used in `select` statement.
