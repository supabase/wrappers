//! Shopify Foreign Data Wrapper for PostgreSQL
//!
//! This module implements a Shopify FDW that allows querying Shopify store data directly from PostgreSQL.
//! It supports various resource types including products, collections, customers, orders, inventory, and more.
//! The FDW leverages the Shopify API to fetch data and supports query pushdown for filtering and sorting.
//!
//! Resources supported:
//! - products: Store items with variants, images, and metadata
//! - product_variants: Variants of products with pricing and inventory data
//! - collections: Custom and smart collections of products
//! - customers: Store customers with addresses and order history
//! - orders: Customer orders with line items, fulfillments, and transactions
//! - inventory: Product inventory levels across locations
//! - metafields: Custom metadata for various Shopify resources
//! - shop: Store information and configuration
